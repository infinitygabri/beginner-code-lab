There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript : 

    * boolean 

        - true or false values.

    * number 

        - whole numbers and floating point values.

    * string

        - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"
        
There are also 2 less common primitives used in later versions of Javascript and TypeScript : 

    * bigint

        - whole numbers and floating point values,
          but allows larger negative and positive numbers than the number type.

    * symbol 

        - are used to create a globally unique identifier.

Type Assignment : 

    - When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type.

        * Explicit

            - writing out the type.

        * Implicit
        
            - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value.
